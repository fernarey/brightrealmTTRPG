# File Descriptions

## .idea

This is a folder that contains the settings for the PyCharm IDE. It is not necessary for the game.

## ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ javaclasses

This is a folder that contains the compiled Java classes. It is not necessary for the game, however, it is helpful to understand the structure of the game and how the classes will be implemented in JavaScript. Reyna should be editing these files to fit what each class should do. Most of them contain pre-written code that can be modified to fit the game, and Reyna should be filling out all of the methods with a `// TODO` comment.

### ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ characters

This folder contains the subclasses for the characters in the game. They all extend the `Person` class. Reyna should extending the `Person` class in each subclass and adding in any extra methods that are necessary for the game. It is worth noting that the `Person` class creates a stat block for each character, and the only reason it is not called Character is because the `Character` class is already used in Java.

### ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ gear

This folder contains the subclasses for the gear in the game. They all extend the `Gear` class. Reyna should be extending the `Gear` class in each subclass and adding in any extra methods that are necessary for the game.

### ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ `Condition.java`

This is a class that contains the conditions that can be applied to characters. It contains the name, description, and affected senses of the condition. The intention is that the conditions will be applied to characters and will affect their stats in some way.

### ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ `Gear.java`

This is a class that contains the gear that can be equipped by characters. It contains the name, description, and price of the gear. Any stat blocks for the gear should be in the subclasses MagicItem and Weapon above.

### ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ `Feature.java`

This is a class that contains the features that can be applied to characters. It contains the name, description, slots, and reset option of the feature. The intention is that the player will be able to view these features and apply them to their character manually.

### ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ `Main.java`

This is the main class for the game. It contains the main method and the game loop. It is the class that should be run to start the game so that Reyna can test all of the classes. 

### ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ `Person.java`

This is a class that defines a character of the game. It utilizes all of the other methods to create a statblock for the character. It contains many fields pertaining to the character, such as name, level, different classes, stats, skills, and proficiencies. Reyna should update the class to fit the game.

### ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ `RPGClass.java`

This is a class that contains the classes that can be chosen by characters. It contains the name, description, and other information about the class. Rina did a poor job at filling out the class, so Reyna should be updating the class to fit the game. The fields that Rina has set out will be used to fill out the character's stat block.

### ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ `Spell.java`

This is a class that contains the spells that can be cast by characters. It contains the name, description, and cost of the spell. Any stat blocks for the spell should be in the subclasses AttackSpell and UtilitySpell above.
